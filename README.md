# Flask Todo List App

Your task is to create a **basic web application** with **Flask** that allows the user to track the things that they need to do.

Below are a set of **user stories** that you need to fulfil:

* As a user, I want to create new tasks, so that I can keep track of what I need to do.
* As a user, I want to edit the description of an existing task, in case the task changes.
* As a user, I want to know which tasks are pending completion, so that I know what I still need to do.
* As a user, I want to set a task as 'complete', so that I can see how much I have achieved.
* As a user, I want to delete a task, in case I don't need to complete it anymore.

Each user story should be tracked as an item on a **project-tracking system**. You may use Jira, GitHub Boards or any equivalent tracking system. For each item, you should use a **feature branch model** to create new work.

Each feature should also be fully **unit tested**. A feature is not complete until it has a unit test written for it.
